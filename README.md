2020-Mar-18 | To workaround the `yad` bug of too high window (e.g. in `akm`), we have created<br> an EndeavourOS version of `yad`.<br>To use it instead of the upstream version, user should edit file `/etc/pacman.conf`<br>and move the `[endeavouros]` repository specification as the first repo.<br> See [this page](https://github.com/endeavouros-team/PKGBUILDS/tree/master/yad) for more details.
