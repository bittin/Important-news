:--- | :---
2021-Apr-07 | Changed the patched `yad` package name to `yad-eos` to avoid further confusion.<br>To use the patched yad, install `yad-eos`:<br>`sudo pacman -Syu yad-eos`
2021-Mar-29 | The Welcome app has a new button **Yad (patched)** under the **Add More Apps** tab.<br>This button installs the patched EndeavourOS version of yad.<br>Note that the button is visible only if your current yad version is older than<br> the EndeavourOS version.<br>See also the 2021-Mar-18 news item below.
2021-Mar-27 | IMPORTANT: in the EndeavourOS *installer* the **Update this app!** button<br>on the Welcome app should not be used for now as it will prevent installing<br>due to incompatible library versions.<br>The next ISO release will not have this issue.
2021-Mar-18 | (NOTE: this method is no more preferred!)<br>To workaround the `yad` bug of too high window (e.g. in `akm`), we have created<br> an EndeavourOS version of `yad`.<br>One way to use it instead of the upstream version is edit file `/etc/pacman.conf`<br>and move the `[endeavouros]` repository specification as the first repo.<br> See [this page](https://github.com/endeavouros-team/PKGBUILDS/tree/master/yad) for more details.<br>See also the 2021-Mar-29 news item above!
